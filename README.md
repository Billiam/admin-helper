# Admin Helper

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Billiam/admin-helper.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Billiam/admin-helper)

Adds summary data for ADMIN timesheet entries based on convention
(any string before the first `:` character will be used as the entry category).

Entries with the same category will have their hours totalled.

Also, turns ADMIN entries green.
